## Hello There!

I'm currently working on mathematical modeling applied to machine learning algorithms, with a focus on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Binary-Structured PINNs (BsPINNs). My work bridges mathematical physics and computational physics, delving into the deep mathematical and philosophical structures that shape one of humanity's most profound and beautiful legacies.

Passionate about the intersection of mathematics, physics, and philosophy, I'm constantly exploring new ways to refine models and challenge the paradigms that define our perception of reality.

### About me

- Undergraduate physicist based in Brazil, currently studying at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte.
- Deeply influenced by Immanuel Kant, Gilles Deleuze and Siddharta Gautama.
- I'm currently facing the Samsara Wheel.
- Aspiring to pursue a Pure Mathematics degree after completing my Physics degree, diving even deeper into the elegance of mathematical structures and abstraction.
- Passionate about exploring esoteric concepts, delving into deep lore, weird complex scientific principles, and philosophical knowledge that transcends conventional understanding.
